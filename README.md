# helm-upgrade-preview
helm-preview compares your live Helm release against a proposed upgrade and produces a clear, actionable diff. It strips Kubernetes noise fields, detects risky changes, identifies resource ownership, and outputs results as a rich terminal display or structured JSON for CI/CD pipelines.
